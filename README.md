# vim-snippets

This is a collection of [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)
snippets I use. No guarantees!

## Installation

### `vim-plug`

```vim
Plug 'Shougo/neosnippet.vim'
Plug 'pbondoer/vim-snippets'

" ...

let g:neosnippet#snippets_directory = globpath(&rtp, 'snippets')
```

I would recommend having [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim)
as well.

## Contents

These will build up over time as I find patterns I frequently type out by hand.

They are intended to be personal, but feel free to use them. Just know I
probably won't be supporting your specific use-cases!
